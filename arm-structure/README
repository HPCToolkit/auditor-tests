this directory contains a simple of the ARM LD_AUDIT problem that fails on many but not all ARM platforms.

the problem that we have identified on ARM that causes trouble is that is in dl-trampoline.S, the _dl_runtime_profile trampoline used by LD_AUDIT
does not save x8, which is used to point to memory where a returned structure will be written. (see document arm.pdf in parent directory)

if the code for the runtime resolver in ld.so happens to overwrite x8, then the bug will be manifest. if the bug doesn't appear with this test, try
the boost thread reproducer, which fails on every ARM system we have tried.
  
command to build and execute the reproducer:
        make
